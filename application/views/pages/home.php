<h1>Pete Albrecht - Web Developer</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a geek, a programmer, a gamer, a media junkie, and an outdoor enthusiast. 
I love programming and the power it gives me to create something from nothing. 
I'm a student of algorithms and I'm fascinated with solving impossibly large problems 
using clever techniques. </p>
<p>When I'm not in the office I love to get outdoors and hit the trail. I've written 
some of my best code in in my head while walking my dog. I like kayaking and mountain 
biking, and I enjoy the mental and physical challenge of archery and marksmanship. 
Whether it's new technologies or new trails I'm always exploring.</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>I started my web development career after working for 10 years in broadcasting 
and print media. I've worked as a photographer, printer, recording engineer, 
even as a director for a local news broadcast. While interesting, all other forms of 
media pale in comparison to the power of the Internet to inform and entertain.</p>
<p>Programming makes me feel like a mage with the power to solve problems, save time, 
waste time, entertain, and create new worlds out of thin air. My first exposure 
to programming was through the book <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a>, 
which I highly recommend. I was instantly hooked. Before long I was using my 
new super powers to solve puzzles on <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> 
and change the text on webpages to funny and inappropriate things. </p>
<p>Like many others, my first project was a pet project I developed to solve a 
particular problem in my life. I'm an avid gamer and one of my favorite series is 
"The Elder Scolls" RPG series. I designed a database of alchemy ingredients and 
effects from various games in the series, wrote some PHP scripts to scrape the data 
from the wiki pages and insert it into relational tables. Finally, using some 
clever SQL, I was able to query the database for ingredients with matching effects 
and list all possible potion recipes given the ingredients I had in my inventory. 
Through the project I not only learned about what's involved in crafting a web 
application, but also developed an affinity for database management and the power 
of SQL.</p>
<p>While working for a photography company I found new ways to apply my programming 
knowledge to solving some interesting. I started writing small Photoshop scripts 
using JavaScript for repetitive tasks like generating proofs and resizing/cropping 
images to different aspect ratios. Eventually I was able to develop a 
<a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>/projects/bin-packing">bin packing algorithm</a> 
to solve the problem of packing different size images to fixed-size sheets of paper. 
Being able to use an fascinating algorithm to solve a unique problem was an experience 
I'll never forget.</p>
