<h1>Pete Albrecht - Web Developer</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I started my web development career after working for 10 years in broadcasting 
and print media. I've worked as a photographer, printer, recording engineer, 
even as a director for a local news broadcast. While interesting, all other forms of 
media pale in comparison to the power of the Internet to inform and entertain.</p>
<p>Like many others, my first project was a pet project I developed to solve a 
particular problem in my life. I'm an avid gamer and one of my favorite series is 
"The Elder Scolls" RPG series. I designed a database of alchemy ingredients and 
effects from various games in the series, wrote some PHP scripts to scrape the data 
from the wiki pages and insert it into relational tables. Finally, using some 
clever SQL, I was able to query the database for ingredients with matching effects 
and list all possible potion recipes given the ingredients I had in my inventory. 
Through the project I not only learned about what's involved in crafting a web 
application, but also developed an affinity for database management and the power 
of SQL.</p>
