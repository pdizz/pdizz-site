<p>Bin packing algorithm derived from 
<a href="https://github.com/jakesgordon/bin-packing">github.com/jakesgordon/bin-packing</a>
and adapted to pack to multiple growing bins with a fixed maximum size. Full 
source code available at <a href="https://github.com/pdizz/Packager">github.com/pdizz/Packager</a>.</p>
<p>This algorithm will pack multiple images to fit on variable-length sheets
printed on roll-paper. It is used in printing school picture packages e.g. a 
sheet of wallets. Because the length of the sheets varies the size of the "bin" 
or sheet must grow to fit the images as they're added without wasting extra space 
or requiring the paper to be cut by hand.</p>
<p>This prototype algorithm was translated into C# and used in our production 
software with great success.</p>
